Problem 6 on 127-128

```{r}

FourthLowers = c(3480, 2412, 1788, 1517, 1248, 963.5, 727.5, 579, 345, 114)
MidSummaries = c(3480, 3678, 4115.5, 4400.5, 4799, 4978.75, 5241, 5394.5, 5510.25, 5494)
FourthUppers = c(3480, 4944, 6443, 7284, 8350, 8994, 9754.5, 10210, 10675.5, 10874)

# writing all thesse data in to the matrix form to #have a glance as it looks in the texxtbook

HouseIncomeData = matrix(data=c(FourthLowers,MidSummaries,FourthUppers), ncol=3)
HouseIncomeData

# according to the equations we saw in the text #book page 120 a = x0 - (T(x0)/Derivat(T(x0))), #similarly b = 1/deriv(t(x0))

Deivative = deriv(~x^(1/3),"x",func=T)
MedianMidsummary = MidSummaries[1]
# now lets calculat b first
ForB = Deivative(MedianMidsummary)
BValue = as.vector(1/ attr(ForB, "gradient"))
# now lets find the A value
AValue = as.vector(MedianMidsummary - BValue*MedianMidsummary^(1/3))
AValue
# to calculate the z value, we need to transform = cube root transfom this data
CuberootTransformation = HouseIncomeData^(1/3)
# now lets find the value of the z
zValue = AValue + BValue*CuberootTransformation
zValue

# lets draw the letter value plot
source("E:/Sem1-DataScience/Exploratory-DA/home-work/hw3/lvalprogs.r")
lval(zValue)
# A values
AValue
# B value
BValue
# compare the two summaries we got
# original Data
HouseIncomeData
# new transformed summaries data
zValue
# if we observe the midsummaries of the two data's The original and the new, they looks similar. So our transfomration makes sense.
